When I followed [Udacity's Python for AI Nanodegree][udacity-python-ai], I created this classifier for my final project. It implements a neural network, using transfer learning, to classify flower breeds.

Using `Pytorch`'s library, I wrote files to process the data, build a neural network, train it, and use it to make predictions.

You can find the corresponding `GitHub` repository [here][nn-flowers].
